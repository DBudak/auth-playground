JWT (JSON Web Token)

	- JWT is a container that carries assertions or claims from one place to another in a cryptographically safe manner
	- JWS becomes JWT if it carriesJSON object as payload and follows compact serialization

	Claims
		iss - identifier for the issuer
		sub - identifier of the subject (or the owner) of the jet
		aud - identifier for the audience (indented recipient).
		exp - expiration time in unix epoch
		iat - issuing time in unix epoch
		nbf - not before. Unix epoch time after which token becomes valid
		jti - unique token identifier in Authorization Service
    Scopes
	    - Define the list of capabilities available to the token
	    - When Client Application requests for a token it can specify scopes. Authorization Service does not have to respect the requested scopes
	Pitfalls
		- if Auth server revokes token API GW will never know and continue to think is valid. Addressed by making JWTs short-lived or pub/subbing this 

-------------------------------------------------
OpenID Connect

	- Additional identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0
	- ID token - signed JWT with user information
	- Access token - signed JWT with ids, sub, aud, iat, exp claims, representing authentication/authorizaiton

	Flow:
		1. Client Application sends scope=openid in token request
		2. ID token is sent along with the access token
